        		      <h2>About Me</h2>

        		          <p>My interest in coding started my first semester of graduate school when I had to create a class webpage to post materials and keep students updated with weekly announcements.  Designing and building that page was one of the highlights in an otherwise very challenging semester.
        		          </p>  

        		          <p>The next several years were consumed by finishing my PhD and starting a career in academia but once life calmed down a bit I started thinking about ways to enrich my life.  Since I had always loved both art and technology I began looking for a way to purse both of those and found that web development was a perfect blend of the two.</p>

        		          <p>In addition to my career in academia, I have worked and volunteered with a variety of organizations and non-profits.  These experiences have given me a unique perspective on what business professionals and clients need out of websites. My diverse professional experiences combined with my passion for tech create a dedicated, knolwedgeable, and passionate web development professional.</p>
